<p><strong class="one">User Obligations:</strong></p>
<p class="two">By downloading, accessing, or using the website in order to view any information, access any materials, or submit information of any kind, User represents that he/she is at least eighteen (18) years of age (or the legal age of majority (whichever is greater)) and will, at all times, provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when submitting information or materials on the website, including, without limitation, when User is prompted to provide information via a website registration or submission form. If User provides any false, inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, Company reserves the right to immediately terminate User’s access to and use of the website. In addition, User agrees to abide by all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations with respect to User’s use of the website. User also acknowledges and agrees that use of the Internet and access to the website is solely at User’s own risk. While Company has endeavoured to create a secure and reliable website, each User should understand that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from the website over the Internet or other form of global communication network cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, Company is not responsible for the security of any information transmitted to or from the website. User must make his/her own determination as to such issues.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Other Terms of Use and Conditions:</strong></p>
<p class="two">Additional notices, Terms of Use and conditions may apply to participation, remittance, or a particular program, service, event, or solution. You agree to abide by such other notices, Terms of Use and conditions, as applicable.

These restricted areas may further require both a user name and a password or adherence to other particular access requirements as designated by Company. Only one user can use one user name and password and, thus, one account. By limiting access, it helps avoid unauthorized usage by other persons, institutions, or entities because anyone with knowledge of both your user name and password can gain entry to the restricted portions of the Website and to your account. Accordingly, by using the website, you agree to consider your user name and password as confidential information and to keep your user name and password confidential. You also agree not to use another User’s user name and password. You will immediately notify Company if you become aware of any loss or theft of your password or any unauthorized use of your user name and password.

By submitting content or information of any type to a forum or other portion of the website or by otherwise using the website to transmit or display a posting, User automatically grants Company a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform, and display such posting (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate into other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such posting.

If a User believes that one or more of its works have been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, User should provide a written notice of the claim of copyright infringement (“DMCA Takedown Notice”) that is directed to Company’s designated agent (“Copyright Agent”), as specified below, along with the following information: • A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; • Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; • Identification of the material claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material; • Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail; • A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and • A statement that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

<p class="two">Company welcomes User’s feedback and suggestions about Company’s programs or services or with respect to how to improve the website. By transmitting any suggestions, information, material, or other content (collectively, “feedback”) to Company, User represents and warrants that such feedback does not infringe or violate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party (including, without limitation, patents, copyrights, or trademark rights) and that User has all rights necessary to convey to Company and enable Company to use such feedback. In addition, any feedback received through the website will be deemed to include a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, non-exclusive right and license for Company to adopt, publish, reproduce, disseminate, transmit, distribute, copy, use, create derivative works, and display (in whole or in part) worldwide, or act on such feedback without additional approval or consideration, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content, and User hereby waives any claim to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Third Party Products &amp; Services:</strong></p>
<p class="two">Company, in its sole discretion may feature and/or post the advertisements of third parties on the website and/or feature on the website materials, programs, products, and services provided by third parties. Company makes no representations with respect to, nor does it guarantee or endorse, the quality, non-infringement, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, or correct sequencing of such third-party materials, programs, products, and services or any other materials, programs, products and services which such third-party materials, products, and services may access. User’s correspondence or any other dealings with third parties found through the website are solely between User and such third party. Accordingly, Company expressly disclaims responsibility and liability for all third-party provided materials, programs, products and services contained on or accessed through the website, and User agrees that Company shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such third parties on the website.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Limitation of Liability:</strong></p>
<p class="two">You expressly absolve and release Company from any claim of harm resulting from a cause beyond Company’s control, including but not limited to, failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other connection problems, computer viruses, unauthorized access, theft, operator errors, severe weather, earthquakes, or natural disasters, strikes, or other labour problems, wars or governmental restrictions. Moreover and to the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall company be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use of this website, with the delay or inability to use this website, the cost of procurement of substitute services or for any information and materials available through this website, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, and even if company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In addition, total liability of company for any reason whatsoever related to use of this website shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to company in connection with the subject matter of the particular dispute.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Choice Of Law And Enforcement:</strong></p>
<p class="two">Any claim you might have against Company must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. You access the website on your own volition and are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws with respect to your access and use of the website. In any legal proceeding brought by Company, Company shall have the right to seek and be awarded all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in addition to any other relief, at law or in equity, to which Company may be entitled.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Enforcing Security On The Website:</strong></p>
<p class="two">Actual or attempted unauthorized use of the website may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution, including, without limitation, punishment under the under law. Company reserves the right to view, monitor, and record activity on the website without notice or permission from you including, without limitation, by archiving notices or communications sent by you through the website. Any information obtained by monitoring, reviewing, or recording is subject to review by law enforcement organizations in connection with investigation or prosecution of possible criminal or unlawful activity on the website as well as to disclosures required by or under applicable law or related government agency actions. Company will also comply with all court orders or subpoenas involving requests for such information. In addition to the foregoing, Company reserves the right to, at any time and without notice, modify, suspend, terminate, or interrupt operation of or access to the website, or any portion of the website in order to protect the website, Company, or Company’s business.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Injunctive Relief:</strong></p>
<p class="two">You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to unauthorized use of Company proprietary assets, will cause irreparable injury to Company, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages and Company would not have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that Company shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this Agreement. Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that Company post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Company to enforce any provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Term &amp; Termination:</strong></p>
<p class="two">This Agreement will take effect (or re-take effect) at the moment you begin downloading, accessing or using the website, whichever is earliest. Company reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraudulent or unlawful activity or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this Agreement, to deny Your access to the website or to any portion thereof in order to protect its name and goodwill, its business, and/or other Users, and this Agreement will also terminate automatically if You fail to comply with its Terms of Use and conditions, subject to the survival rights of certain provisions identified below. Termination will be effective without notice and may impact your membership status with Company. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing to use the website, but all applicable provisions of this Agreement will survive termination, as identified below, and each re-access or use of the website will reapply this Agreement (then in effect) to You. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of any aspect of the website in your possession. The provisions concerning Company’s proprietary rights, feedback and submissions, disclaimers of warranty, limitations of liability, waiver and severability, entire agreement, injunctive relief and governing law will survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Waiver &amp; Severability:</strong></p>
<p class="two">Failure to insist on strict performance of any of the Terms of Use and conditions of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. No waiver by Company of any right under this Agreement will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
<p><strong class="one">Entire agreement:</strong></p>
<p class="two">No joint venture, partnership, employment, affiliate, or agency relationship exists between you and Company as result of this Agreement or your utilization of the website. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to use of the website, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between you and Company with respect to the website.
